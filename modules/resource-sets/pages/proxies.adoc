= Proxy Sets
Proxy resource sets are used to create multiple sets of Pulsar proxies. Each resource set has its own configuration.
Pulsar can communicate with many different application clients, such as Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ, through proxy extensions.
{pulsar-operator} can manage these dedicated proxy extensions with resource sets.
