= Getting started

{pulsar-operator} can be installed in two ways.

* xref:getting-started:operator.adoc[Pulsar Operator] - Installs just the operator pod and PulsarCluster CRDs.

* xref:getting-started:stack.adoc[Pulsar Stack] - Installs and deploys the operator, a Pulsar cluster, and a full Prometheus monitoring stack.

[TIP]
====
If you have an existing Pulsar cluster, you can scan and generate an equivalent PulsarCluster CRD. For more, see xref:features:migrate-cluster.adoc[].
