= PulsarCluster Resource Definition
A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API, and a Custom Resource Definition defines the state of a resource and how it is managed.
The PulsarCluster resource is a custom resource that defines the PulsarCluster resource, which is used by the {pulsar-operator} to manage Pulsar cluster resources.
A Pulsar cluster can be deployed and managed just by generating a PulsarCluster resource and applying it to the Kubernetes cluster.
Subsequent changes to the PulsarCluster resource will be applied to the Pulsar cluster.
This greatly simplifies Pulsar cluster management. Difficulties like decommissioning bookies or scaling brokers are now as simple as editing a PulsarCluster resource and applying the changes with the {pulsar-operator}.

Read on to see how to install the {pulsar-operator}, create the PulsarCluster resource, and deploy a Pulsar cluster.
