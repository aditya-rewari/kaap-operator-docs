= K8s Autoscaler for Apache Pulsar (KAAP)

Kubernetes Autoscaling for Apache Pulsar (KAAP) simplifies running [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org) on Kubernetes by applying the familiar [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) to Pulsar's components, and horizonally scaling resources up or down based on CPU and memory workloads.

Full documentation is available in the https://docs.datastax.com/en/streaming/pulsar-operator/index.html[DataStax Streaming Documentation].

== Apache Pulsar

Apache Pulsar is an open-source distributed pub-sub messaging platform designed to handle real-time data streams and event-driven architectures. It offers a highly scalable and durable messaging system that allows seamless communication and processing of data among diverse applications and services. Pulsar provides advanced features like multi-tenancy, geo-replication, message replay, and schema enforcement, enabling organizations to build robust, reliable, and flexible data streaming pipelines. With its horizontally scalable architecture and extensive ecosystem integrations, Apache Pulsar empowers businesses to efficiently manage and process massive amounts of data while ensuring low-latency and high-throughput messaging capabilities.

== KAAP Operator

Operating and maintaining Apache Pulsar clusters traditionally involves complex manual configurations, making it challenging for developers and operators to effectively manage the system's lifecycle. However, with the Apache Pulsar Kubernetes Operator, these complexities are abstracted away, enabling developers to focus on their applications rather than the underlying infrastructure.

This operator acts as an extension to the Kubernetes API, introducing custom resource definitions (CRDs) specific to Apache Pulsar. With these CRDs, users can define Pulsar clusters, topics, subscriptions, and other resources as native Kubernetes objects. The operator then reconciles the desired state defined by these objects with the actual state of the Pulsar cluster, ensuring that the cluster is always in the desired configuration.

After a new custom resource type is added to your cluster by installing a CRD, you can create instances of the resource based on its specification.
The Kubernetes API can be extended to support the new resource type, automating away the tedious aspects of managing a Pulsar cluster.

== Details

KAAP is configured, deployed, and packaged with Helm charts and based on the https://quarkiverse.github.io/quarkiverse-docs/quarkus-operator-sdk/dev/index.html[Quarkus Operator SDK].
