= Bookkeeper Sets
With a https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/administration-isolation-bookie/#rack-aware-placement-policy[rack-aware deployment], {pulsar-operator} can set the data placement policy automatically.
Every entry will be stored as much as possible in different failure domains to guarantee rack-level fault tolerance.

The auto-configuration of rack-awareness is enabled by default, and is configured in the Bookkeeper configuration section:
[source,helm]
----
bookkeeper:
	autoRackConfig:
		enabled: true
		periodMs: 60000
----
[NOTE]
====
The autoRackConfig feature requires `bookkeeperClientRegionawarePolicyEnabled=true` in the broker configuration.
Fortunately, {pulsar-operator} will automatically add this configuration property in the broker and autorecovery values.
====

If you wish to disable the region-aware policy, you need to explicitly set `bookkeeperClientRegionawarePolicyEnabled=false` in the broker and autorecovery configuration.
