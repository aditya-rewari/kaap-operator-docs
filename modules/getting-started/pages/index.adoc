= Getting started
{pulsar-operator} comes in two distinct flavors:

* xref:getting-started:operator.adoc[Pulsar Operator] - Install just the operator pod into an existing Pulsar cluster.

* xref:getting-started:stack.adoc[Pulsar Stack] - Installs and deploys the operator, a Pulsar cluster, and a full Prometheus monitoring stack.

If you have an existing Pulsar cluster, you can scan and generate an equivalent PulsarCluster CRD. For more, see xref:migrating:index.adoc[].

Optionally, you can xref:getting-started:source.adoc[build the operator from source].
