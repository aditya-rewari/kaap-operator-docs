= Getting started

{pulsar-operator} can be installed in two ways.

* xref:getting-started:operator.adoc[{pulsar-operator}] - Installs just the operator pod and PulsarCluster CRDs.

* xref:getting-started:stack.adoc[{pulsar-stack}] - Installs and deploys the operator, a Pulsar cluster, and a full Prometheus monitoring stack.

[TIP]
====
If you have an existing Pulsar cluster, you can scan and generate an equivalent PulsarCluster CRD. For more, see xref:migration:migrate-cluster.adoc[].
