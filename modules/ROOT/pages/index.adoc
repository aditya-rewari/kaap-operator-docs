= {pulsar-operator}

{pulsar-operator} simplifies running https://pulsar.apache.org[Apache Pulsar] on Kubernetes.

This guide offers a starting point for {pulsar-operator}.
We will cover installation and deployment, configuration points, and further options for managing Pulsar components with the {pulsar-operator}.

== Features

After a new custom resource type is added to your cluster by installing a CRD, you can create instances of the resource based on its specification.
The Kubernetes API can be extended to support the new resource type, automating away the tedious aspects of managing a Pulsar cluster.

* xref:scaling-components:autoscale-bookies.adoc[Bookkeeper autoscaler] - Automatically scale the number of bookies based on memory usage.
* xref:scaling-components:autoscale-brokers.adoc[Broker autoscaler] - Automatically scale the number of brokers based on CPU load.
* xref:resource-sets:resource-sets.adoc[Rack-aware bookkeeper placement] - Place bookies in different racks to guarantee high availability.
* xref:scaling-components:kafka.adoc[Kafka API] - Use the Starlight for Kafka API to bring your Kafka message traffic to Pulsar.

== How {pulsar-operator} makes Pulsar easier

Operators are a common pattern for packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes applications.
Operators extend Kubernetes functionality to automate common tasks in stateful applications.
Think of {pulsar-operator} as a manager for the individual components of Pulsar. By implementing the pulsarCluster Custom Resource Definition, the operator knows enough to manage the deployment, configuration, and scaling of Pulsar components with re-usable and automated tasks, such as:

* Deploying a Pulsar cluster
* Deploying monitoring and logging components
* Autoscaling bookies based on memory usage, or brokers based on CPU load
* Assigning resources to specific availability zones (AZs)

{pulsar-operator} is configured, deployed, and packaged with Helm charts and based on the https://quarkiverse.github.io/quarkiverse-docs/quarkus-operator-sdk/dev/index.html[Quarkus Operator SDK].

== Pulsar component architecture

A typical Pulsar cluster *requires* the following components:

* https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-architecture-overview/#metadata-store[Zookeeper^]{external-link-icon} - This is Pulsar’s meta data store. It stores data about a cluster’s configuration, helps the proxy direct messages to the correct broker, and holds Bookie configurations.

* https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-architecture-overview/#brokers[Broker^]{external-link-icon} - This is Pulsar's message router.

* https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-architecture-overview/#apache-bookkeeper[Bookkeeper (bookie)^]{external-link-icon} - This is Pulsar’s data store.
Bookkeeper stores message data in a low-latency, resilient way.

In addition to the required components, you might want to include some *optional components*:

* https://bookkeeper.apache.org/docs/admin/autorecovery[Bookkeeper AutoRecovery^]{external-link-icon} - This is a Pulsar component that recovers Bookkeeper data in the event of a bookie outage.
* https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/concepts-architecture-overview/#pulsar-proxy[Pulsar proxy^]{external-link-icon} - The Pulsar proxy is just that - a proxy that runs at the edge of the cluster with public facing endpoints.
Pulsar proxy also offers special options for cluster extensions, like our [Starlight Suite of APIs].
* https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/functions-worker-run-separately/[Dedicated functions worker(s)^]{external-link-icon} - You can optionally run dedicated function workers in a Pulsar cluster.
* xref:luna-streaming:components:admin-console-tutorial.adoc[Pulsar AdminConsole] - This is an optional web-based admin console for managing Pulsar clusters.
* xref:luna-streaming:components:heartbeat-vm.adoc[Pulsar Heartbeat] - This is an optional component that monitors the health of Pulsar cluster and emits metrics about the cluster that are helpful for observing and debugging issues.
* Prometheus/Grafana/Alert manager stack - This is the default observability stack for a cluster. The Luna Helm chart includes pre-made dashboards in Grafana and pre-wires all the metrics scraping.

== How {pulsar-operator} installs Pulsar

{pulsar-operator} can be installed in two ways.

* xref:getting-started:operator.adoc[Pulsar Operator] - Installs just the operator and PulsarCluster CRDs into an existing Pulsar cluster.

* xref:getting-started:stack.adoc[Pulsar Stack] - Installs and deploys the operator, a Pulsar cluster, and a full Prometheus monitoring stack.

[TIP]
====
You can also scan an existing Pulsar cluster and generate an equivalent PulsarCluster CRD. For more, see xref:migration:migrate-cluster.adoc[].
